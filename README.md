# ConjugationTest

-------- Description --------
This is a simple gui project made in wxwidgets to help teach german conjugation of verbs.

The program loads xml files which hold the base and conjugated forms of the verbs.


--------- Short Manaual ----------

You can fill in the description and derived forms then go to file->save to generate a xml file to 
test your self against. You can load the file then with file->Open and selecting the file.

The program also has an optional timer which you can change the time and also enable and disable

--------- Building -------

Linux: 
Your going to have to compile from source.
You need to first build the wx-widgets library from source as shown [here](https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Compiling_and_getting_started)
Once you have the wx library compiled, run make

Windows: 
Within the builds directory their is a .exe that works for windows. NOTE I have only tested on Win 10.
If someone would enjoy testing the software on different enviroments, both Linux builds and windows
that would be greatly appreciated.

--------- Help ----------
If anyone wants to help out either by tweaking code, or contributing base example words, that would
be really helpful!
